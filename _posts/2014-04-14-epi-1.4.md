<h2>Release 1.4</h2>

<font style="color:red;">We're celebrating Release 1.4 with our first ever sale!</font>
<p>


The biggest change is that we added roughly 60 new problems and 40 new variants.
All of the new problems
are basic programming exercises (e.g., "reverse the sublist consisting of nodes L to U in a singly linked list"). However,
they require careful coding to deal with corner-cases.
<p>
We retired the same number of problems.
The retired problems were more appropriate for quant interviews. Specifically, they were
very math oriented. Most all of our readers are focused on software developer positions, and the retired problems, though
fascinating, were a distraction.
<p>
Some other changes: 
<ol>
<li>We reworded text in many places to it read easier.
<li>We added more details to a number of solutions. (For example, we start many solutions with brute-force solutions that we then refine into an optimum solution.)
<li>We give better algorithms for several of the original problems.
<li>Finally, we fixed many small typos and bugs. 
</ol>
