<b>We wrote EPI for you!</b>

EPI began as a Google Doc which we prepared for our friends who wanted to join companies
like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as hot startups.

Like you, they had talent, but were not familiar with the interviewing style
at these companies, and often failed to land their dream job.

For example, many of our friends had engineering and science degrees, or had been out of college for a while,
and were not prepared for data structures and algorithms interview questions.

Others had degrees in Computer Science, but had worked on legacy products 
at large companies.

similarly, students (our juniors) from around the world, from smaller universities, who were really really good
but didnt know the inside guide to more new exciting companies, and their interview style
{%endcomment%}

EPI evens the playing field. Combined with your hard work, it will enable you
to interview successfully at the best companies.
