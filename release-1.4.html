    Summary of verson 1.4

<h2 id="about">Version 1.4 <i class="icon-double-angle-right"></i></h2>

<ul>
<li>
We added roughly 60 new problems and 40 new variants
Many of these are basic programming exercises ("reverse the sublist consisting of nodes L to U in a singly linked list"), but require careful coding to deal with corner-cases.

<li>We retired the same number of problems.
Most of the retired problems were more appropriate for quant interviews, i.e., very math oriented. We found that almost all of our readers are focused on software developer positions, and many were frustrated by the math problems.

<li>Some other changes:
<ul>
<li>We reworded text in many places to it read easier.
<li>We added more details to a number of solutions. (For example, we start many solutions with brute-force solutions that we then refine into an optimum solution.)
<li>We give better algorithms for several of the original problems.
<li>Finally, we fixed many small typos and bugs.
</ul>
</ul>
